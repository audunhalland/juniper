error[E0080]: evaluation of constant value failed
  --> fail/interface/struct/derive_additional_non_nullable_argument.rs:17:5

17 |     id: String,
   |     ^^ evaluation panicked: Failed to implement interface `Character` on `ObjA`: Field `id`: Argument `isPresent` of type `Boolean!` isn't present on the interface and so has to be nullable.

   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::panic::panic_2021` which comes from the expansion of the macro `::juniper::assert_field` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
